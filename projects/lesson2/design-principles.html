            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <h4>Amazon</h4>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=boxing+gloves&crid=3RZ0HBBVKRBXK&sprefix=boxing+gloves%2Caps%2C150&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">Amazon.com</a>
            <img src="images/fitts-law.png" alt="Fitt's Law">
            <p>This websight exemplifies Fitt's law by having several different sizes of buttons. All meant to be easier or harder 
                To click. To filter your results differently (Which you do not want to do by mistake) You have to click on a very small button.
                Likewise the buttons for the navigation bar, profile page, and kart are quite small. With the largest buttons being the individual
                products. This is where all the money is made.

        <div id="proximity-box">
            <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
            <h4>The Lethbridge Public Library</h4>
            <a href="http://www.lethlib.ca/">Lethlib.ca</a>
            <img src="images/proximity.png" alt="Fitt's Law">
            <p>Allthough this webpage is a very good example of proximity. It doenst work as well on mobile. 
                There are so many secions of buttons, including the naviagtion bar at the top, a search bar for books, 
                a line of images that link to different upcoming activities, positioned right above infromation on the currently 
                selected activity. And then below that is a calendar.

            <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>
            <h4>RPG Bot</h4>
            <a href="https://rpgbot.net/dnd5/characters/classes/warlock/">Rpgbot.net</a>
            <img src="images/contrast.png" alt="Fitt's Law">
            <p>I really like how this websight uses contrast. (The mobile version, not the web version.)
                First of all, its white text on a black background. Secondly it uses bold versions of Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. 
                These colors are used to emphasize and differenciate different parts of the text.
