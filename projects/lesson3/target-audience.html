        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The target audience is generally people who are looking to be more involved in 
            the lethrbidge community. This demographic is pretty much exclusively adults, 
            and would mostly be those of higher income with time to spare. The most likely
            way they are acessing the site is through computer, though I would like it to be 
            able to work just as well on a phone.
